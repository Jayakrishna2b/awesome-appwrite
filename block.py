//To create a code block in most programming and markup languages, you can use backticks (`) to enclose the code.

//To Markdown or many chat interfaces, you can use backticks like this

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

//Example usage
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
